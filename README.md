The word baluga is a term used to refer to the Aetas, the curly-haired, very dark-skinned indigenous peoples of the Philippines who are related more to the native tribes of Papua New Guinea who bear a closer physical resemblance to a few African groups than to the brown Malayans of Southeast Asia

These people are commonly found in the Northern part region of the Philippines
